This is a file script written during the quiz portion of a job interview.

The purpose of this script is to sort files that are located in a specified working directory.  Those sorted files are then placed in a backup directory such that each set of file extensions will have their own subdirectory.

The initial timeframe for writing this script was one hour.

I was able to complete the first part of the quiz (the backup and sort) but I was unable to complete the second (writing test files to prove the script works).

Looking at updating this script and incorporating tests.  Planning on keeping them in this repo instead of creating a new one as I initially planned.

Made some updates to the script so it's not even the same as when I last spent any significant time on it.  Still needing some tests, though.
